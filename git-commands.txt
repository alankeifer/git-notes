1. make a directory/repo to be tracked by git 
   >> git init  

2. add username and email 
   >> git config user.name="alan keifer" 
   >> git config user.email="keifer.alan@gmail.com" 

3. Check git logs: 
   >> git log
   >> git log --author="alan" 

4. Add files to staging area: 
   >> git add . 
   >> git add filename

5. Do a commit :
   >> git commit -m "1st commit" 

6. Check status : 
   >> git status  

7. List differences between the working copy of file 
   and the ones already in repository. 
   >> git diff 

8. Once you modify a working copy of a file and do a "git add filename" 
   then a "git diff filename"  will not show any differences that you have
   made.  
   
   "git diff" compares only the working copy and the file in repo. 
   "git diff --staged" compares the files in staging area and ones in repo.
